# Serve Qwen2.5-32B with vLLM on TPU VMs.

In this guide, we show how to serve Qwen2.5-32B ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B)).

## Step 0: Install `gcloud cli`

You can reproduce this experiment from your dev environment (e.g. your laptop). You need to install `gcloud` locally to complete this tutorial.

To install `gcloud cli` please follow this guide: [Install the gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#mac)

Once it is installed, you can login to GCP from your terminal with this command: `gcloud auth login`.

## Step 1: Create a v6e TPU instance

We create a single VM with 4 trillium chips - if you need a different number of chips, you can set a different value for `--topology` such as `1x1`, `2x4`, etc.

To learn more about topologies: [v6e VM Types](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/v6e#vm-types).

```bash
export TPU_NAME=your-tpu-name
export ZONE=your-tpu-zone 
export PROJECT=your-tpu-project

# this command creates a tpu vm with 4 Trillium (v6e) chips - adjust it to suit your needs
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm create $TPU_NAME \
    --type v6e --topology 2x2 \
    --project $PROJECT --zone $ZONE --version v2-alpha-tpuv6e
```

## Step 2: ssh to the instance

```bash
gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $TPU_NAME --project $PROJECT --zone=$ZONE
```

## Step 3: Use the latest vllm docker image for TPU
We use a pinned image but you can change it to `vllm/vllm-tpu:nightly` to get the latest TPU nightly image.

```bash
export DOCKER_URI=vllm/vllm-tpu:nightly
```

## Step 4: Run the docker container in the TPU instance

```bash
sudo docker run -t --rm --name $USER-vllm --privileged --net=host -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm --shm-size 10gb -p 8000:8000 --entrypoint /bin/bash -it ${DOCKER_URI}
```

## Step 5: Set up env variables
Export your hugging face token along with other environment variables inside the container.

```bash
export HF_HOME=/dev/shm
export HF_TOKEN=<your HF token>
```

## Step 6: Serve the model

Now we serve the vllm server. Make sure you keep this terminal open for the entire duration of this experiment.

```bash
export MAX_MODEL_LEN=4096
export TP=4 # number of chips
# export RATIO=0.8
# export PREFIX_LEN=0

VLLM_USE_V1=1 vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B --seed 42 --disable-log-requests --gpu-memory-utilization 0.98 --max-num-batched-tokens 2048 --max-num-seqs 128 --tensor-parallel-size $TP --max-model-len $MAX_MODEL_LEN
```

It takes a few minutes depending on the model size to prepare the server - once you see the below snippet in the logs, it means that the server is ready to serve requests or run benchmarks:

```bash
INFO:     Started server process [7]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## Step 7: Prepare the test environment

Open a new terminal to test the server and run the benchmark (keep the previous terminal open).

First, we ssh into the TPU vm via the new terminal:

```bash
export TPU_NAME=your-tpu-name
export ZONE=your-tpu-zone
export PROJECT=your-tpu-project

gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $TPU_NAME --project $PROJECT --zone=$ZONE
```

## Step 8: access the running container

```bash
sudo docker exec -it $USER-vllm bash
```

## Step 9: Test the server.

Let's submit a test request to the server. This helps us to see if the server is launched properly and we can see legitimate response from the model.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B",
        "prompt": "I love the mornings, because ",
        "max_tokens": 200,
        "temperature": 0
    }'
```

## Step 9: Preparing the test image

You might need to install datasets as it's not available in the base vllm image.

```bash
pip install datasets
```

## Step 10:  Run the benchmarking

Finally, we are ready to run the benchmark:

```bash
export MAX_INPUT_LEN=1800
export MAX_OUTPUT_LEN=128
export HF_TOKEN=<your HF token>

cd /workspace/vllm

python benchmarks/benchmark_serving.py \
    --backend vllm \
    --model "Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B"  \
    --dataset-name random \
    --num-prompts 1000 \
    --random-input-len=$MAX_INPUT_LEN \
    --random-output-len=$MAX_OUTPUT_LEN \
    --seed 100
    # --random-range-ratio=$RATIO \
    # --random-prefix-len=$PREFIX_LEN
```

The snippet below is what youâ€™d expect to see - the numbers vary based on the vllm version, the model size and the TPU instance type/size.

```bash
